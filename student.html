								<h2>Meera Mysore</h2>
								<p>Meera started dancing when she was about 4 years old. She started with Ballet and started learning Bharathanatyam when she was 5 in India with her mother, Mala. After she moved back to Maryland in 2010, Meera continued to dance through high school, and learned Ballet, Jazz and Tap. During her undergraduate education at UMBC, Meera minored in Dance. She was also part of her University's athletic dance team and performed at basketball games. Meera also co-founded and was captain of her school's only classical Indian dance team. After graduating, she moved back to New Jersey to pursue a scientist position in cancer research and started re-training under Guru Vidushi Smt. Sushama Shreyas. Meera is excited to be performing her Rangapravesham and feels like it is the beginning of her dance career. She has been extremely passionate about dance all her life and feels like this is a showcase of her dedication and committment to Bharathanatyam.For the last year, she has travelled back and forth between Maryland and New Jersey and has thoroughly enjoyed the journey of learning her Margam. Meera graduated from Drexel in 2022 with her Masters in Biomedical Engineering and Business and currently works as a scientist in Maryland. Apart from work and dance, Meera enjoys travelling, cooking, reading and spending time with her friends and family. She is grateful for all of the support she has received during this journey.</p>
